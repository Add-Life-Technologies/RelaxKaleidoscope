For a demo scene, you need to import the standard Asset Unity - "Characters".


How it works?

1. You need to attach the AudioSource to the GameObject Player and leave it empty.
2. Then attach the ERMP_Player.cs script.
3. Select the mode in the attached script ("Background at Start" or "Trigger").
3.1. If you chose "Trigger", then you need to create any object and set the Collider "Is Trigger" checkbox.
3.2. It's also necessary to assign an "Background_Music" tag or any other tag that you specify in the script.
4. Add your music\sounds to the script.
5. Enjoy!
